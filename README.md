# Note-Prediction
#### Our main goal from the start was to apply the concepts of the Fourier Transform in such a way that it would be useful to a real-world scenario. Although there were many projects one could do with this concept after pondering through some of them, we finally decided to go with note recognition as this project not only tests our knowledge to a great extent but also uses other concepts taught to us while studying signals and systems.
